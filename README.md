Smartphones have an emerging ability to use sensors to measure our physical inputs from outside and convert them into data. There are several kinds of sensors such as Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer, Proximity Sensor, and so on. In this project, we will only focus on the two sensors, the Accelerometer and the Gyroscope, which can help us estimate the status of walking or running. We want to know how the sensors detect the difference between the different statuses and how it might differ when the sensors are in different positions(left or right wrist), additionally explore the dataset as much as we can.
